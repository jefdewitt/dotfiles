# Dotfiles

Personal configurations, scripts and documentation. The goal? Script all the things.

## Highlights 

### Disaster recovery / Onboarding 
- [`New computer? No problem. Grab coffee and let it configure itself.`](https://github.cdinteractive.com/cj-taylor/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/workflows/new-computer)

### Day-to-day 
- [`Found something in a project that's highly manual and want to script away the problem for now?`](https://github.cdinteractive.com/cj-taylor/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/projects)
    - Note: Try to solve the root problem after you apply a bandaid like this. 
- [`Can't remember how you installed that one thing? Script it out for next time.`](https://github.cdinteractive.com/cj-taylor/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/apps)
- [`Want to share a scripted workflow with future you or others?`](https://github.cdinteractive.com/cj-taylor/dotfiles/tree/master/scripts/workflows)
