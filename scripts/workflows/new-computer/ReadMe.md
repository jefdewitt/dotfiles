# New-Computer 

So, you have a fresh computer that you want to get setup and ready for development. Manual works, but how about a scripted setup? 

## How to use

1. Clone this repo 
2. Set an environment variable 
    - `export DEV_PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/proj`
3. Run the script 
    - `cd dotfiles`
    - `./scripts/workflows/new-computer/setup.sh`
4. Grab coffee and wait 
    - While you wait, want to know what it does? [Look here](https://github.cdinteractive.com/cj-taylor/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/workflows/new-computer/setup.sh)
5. Start developing on your new digs
