# New-Computer

So, you have a fresh computer (replacement/new-hire) that you want to get setup and ready for development. Manual works, but how about a scripted setup?

### What role are you serving in?

- [`Frontend`](#how-to-use---frontend)
- [`Backend`](#how-to-use---backend)
- [`Designers`](#how-to-use---designers)
- [`Devops`](#how-to-use---devopsers)

Or, would you like to wire up your computer like [`CJ?`](#how-to-use---cj)

## How to use - Frontend

1. Clone this repo
    - `git clone https://github.cdinteractive.com/cj-taylor/dotfiles.git`
2. Set an environment variable
    - `export DEV_PROJECTS_ROOT=$HOME/proj`
3. Run the script
    - `cd dotfiles`
    - `./scripts/workflows/new-computer/setup-frontend-workstation.sh`
4. Grab coffee and wait
    - While you wait, want to know what it does? [Look here](https://github.cdinteractive.com/cj-taylor/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/workflows/new-computer/setup-frontend-workstation.sh)
5. Start developing on your new digs
