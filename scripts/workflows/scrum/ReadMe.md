# Workflows - Scrum 

Sometimes it's cool to help make other peoples' lives easier. In this case, the Scrum master. Let's try to factor out some menial tasks! 

## [`Retro - Clear reusable retro board`](scrum/bookmarklet-clear-retro-board.js)

**"The what":** We've been using a website to tackle retros ([ideaboardz](http://www.ideaboardz.com/)) as a team. This site has a board with multiple columns where many "sticky" notes can be created. 

**"The why":** We've been "reusing" these boards for retros, and the site doesn't enable mass-deletion of the "stickies." Clearing these boards for reuse is cumbersome. 

**"The how":** So, instead of shifting the workflow to "new board per retro," enter stage left; a bookmarklet that emulates the mass-manual-deletion of the stickies! 

### How to use

1. Create a bookmark for the script! (first time use only) 
  - Follow through (mostly): https://mreidsma.github.io/bookmarklets/installing.html
  - When asked for the address, paste in the script. [`Script - Clear reusable retro board`](scrum/bookmarklet-clear-retro-board.min.js)
1. Ensure you've first exported the board so you don't inadvertedly nuke your precious team retro!
1. View the retro-board, then click the bookmarklet. 

> Buyer beware, this goes through the stickies quickly, it's been observed that you may need to "rinse, repeat" a couple of times to ensure the full deletion.
